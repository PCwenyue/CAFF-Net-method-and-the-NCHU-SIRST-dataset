# Dataset Description
The NCHU-SIRST dataset are divided into 273 training frames and 317 test frames, 
and the target scene is roughly classified into six categories: architecture, cloudless sky, 
complex clouds, continuous clouds, sea, and trees.The annotation form is XML.
 
### Dataset Statistics
52% of the targets are   pixels, 32% of the targets are   pixels, 14% of the targets are 
pixels, and only 2% of the targets are   pixels.
19% of the images belong to architecture type, 2% of the images belong to cloudless sky type,
21% of the images belong to complex cloud type, 26% of the images belong to continuous clouds type, 
7% of the images belong to sea type, and 25% of the images belong to Trees type.
